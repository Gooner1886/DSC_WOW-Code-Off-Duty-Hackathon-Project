        <p class="lead">The name Mysore is an anglicised version of Mahishūru, which means the abode of Mahisha in the vernacular Kannada. The
        common noun Mahisha, in Sanskrit, means buffalo; in this context, however, Mahisha refers to Mahishasura, a mythical demon who could assume
        the form of both human and buffalo, who, according to Hindu Mythology, ruled the ancient parts of Mysore Kingdom, known in Sanskrit as
        Mahíšhaka, centred at Mahishapura. In response to the prayer by the Gods and Goddesses to save them from the demon, Goddess Parvathi, took
        birth as Chamundeshwari and killed the monster on top of the Chamundi hill near Mysore. Hence the hill and the city have the names Chamundi
        Hill and Mysore respectively. It is said that after killing the monster the Goddess stayed on top of the hill, where she is worshipped with
        great devotion to this day. The famous 10 daylong Dasara of Mysore is in honour of the Goddess Chamundeshwari and is a celebration of this
        victory of good over evil.
        <!--The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and, under Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, the kingdom annexed-->
        <!--large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu, to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan. During the reign-->
        <!--of Krishnaraja Wodeyar III the town of Mysore expanded and moved beyond the walls of the fort. Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV developed Mysore into-->
        <!--a beautiful city with excellent planning. Under his reign Mysore became famous for its wide roads, magnificent building and elegant parks.-->
        <!--The Mysore municipality was established in 1888 and the city was divided into eight wards. In 1897 an outbreak of bubonic plague killed-->
        <!--nearly half of the population of the city. With the establishment of the City Improvement Trust Board (CITB) in 1903, Mysore became one of-->
        <!--the first cities in Asia to undertake planned development of the city. Public demonstrations and meetings were held there during the Quit-->
        <!--India Movement and other phases of the Indian Independence Movement. Today, Mysore is a modern city that has managed to retain its quaint
        old world charm. --> Mysore is famous in the world for its sandalwood and rosewood artifacts, stone sculptures, incense sticks, inlay work with
        ivory and its exquisite silk sarees.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Mysore Palace<br><br></h2>
        <p class="lead" style = "padding: 5px 25px 15px 5px;">The current Mysuru Palace – the fourth to occupy this site – was designed by the British architect Henry Irwin after its
        predecessor was destroyed in a fire in 1897. The imposing building that stands today was completed in 1912, but it is believed that a Mysuru
        Palace was established as part of a wooden fortress, by the royal family of Mysuru, the Wodeyars, as early as the fourteenth century. The
        glory of the new building was to prove short-lived. During these turbulent times the Mysuru Palace slipped into a state of neglect
        culminating in its demolition in 1793 by Tipu Sultan. In 1799, when upon the death of Tipu Sultan the five-year old Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (1794-1868) AD assumed the throne.
        One of king’s first tasks, on his accession, was to commission a new palace built in the
        Hindu architectural style and completed in 1803. The hastily constructed palace soon fell into disrepair. The destiny of the Mysuru Palace now passed to well-known British architect Henry Irwin to build a new palace that would be a tribute to the legacy of Mysuru and the Wodeyars.
        Completed in 1912 and at a cost of Rs. 41,47,913 the result was the Mysuru Palace you see standing today. A masterpiece in Indo-Saracenic architecture, on par with great Mughal residences of the North and the stately colonial public buildings of the South.
